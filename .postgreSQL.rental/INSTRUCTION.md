A small video store has around 2000 DVDs, the loan of which must be controlled. Every DVD has an identification number and contains a single film. Each film receives its own identifier, and it is known title and category (comedy, drama, adventure, â€¦). For each registered film there is at least one DVD. Additionally, longer films require two DVDs. Customers may want to find films starring their favorite actor. Therefore, it is necessary to keep information of the actors who star in each film, but not every film has stars. Many customers, when they see the list of actors in the chosen film, are interested in knowing, for a given actor, his real name and which other films of the same genre that actor participated in. The rental company has many registered customers, whose name, surname, telephone number and contact address are known. Furthermore, each customer receives a membership number. Finally, the system should allow consultation of DVD loans, with information on which customer rented what, loan and return dates, amount paid or payable, delays, etc.
